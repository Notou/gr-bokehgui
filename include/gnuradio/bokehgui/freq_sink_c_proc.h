     * \details
     * This block is part of Bokeh based frequency sink for complex values.
     *
     * This is a buffer store that takes set of a complex point streams
     * and stores the PSD. The corresponding Python class retrieve the
     * buffer data and plot the signals using Bokeh library.
     *
     * A queue of 2D array is maintained. Each 2D array is of size
     * \p nconnection \p x \p d_size. For each call to get the data from
     * Python, first element of queue is sent.
     *
     * The sink supports storing complex data or messages. The message port
     * is named "in". When using message port, \p nconnections should be
     * set to 0. An option for "Float Message" is provided in GRC to use
     * message mode.
     *
     * This sink can plot messages that contain either uniform vectors
     * of float 32 values (pmt::is_f32vector) or PDUs where the data
     * is a uniform vector of float 32 values.
